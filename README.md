# Differential-equations
      ___ F(x,y) = Y' = 2e^x -y; ___
To solve an initial value differential equation problem, this projects has:
1) euler method for approximation of solution
2) Improved euler method
3) Runge Kutta method
4) Analytical solution/ exact solution

* This project contains a GUI that plots the results of these methods and their errors.
* It allows the user to change the values of Xnode, X, and N from the GUI
* It allows the user to choose which methods they want to see plottted
